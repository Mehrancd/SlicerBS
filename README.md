# SlicerBS
A Slicer module for brain extraction and segmentation

help:

1- Before brain labeling, using check box optimize the brain extract param (higher value, smaller brain mask)

2- uncheck the box and set iteration as 1 to provide brain label

3-alpha, beta and gamma are the weights of decision for atlas, intensity and Tsallis approches in Markov Random field 

4-Iteration is for Markov Random field calculation for all voxel neighbors, increasing might take time to finish (6 min for 1 it)
