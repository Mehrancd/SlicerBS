# Tsallis Brain Segmentation
A Slicer module for brain extraction and segmentation

Help:

1- Before brain labeling, you can use the first box to create a mask for the brain (brain extractor parameter for higher value, smaller brain mask will be created using beepbrain module)

2- For brain segmentation, a head image, a mask and a lable map for export the result is needed.

- q is the parameter for Tsallis entropy calculation (Sq).
- alpha is the parameter showing the weight of Tsallis entropy-Markov decision 
- beta is the parameter showing the weight of image histogram intensity decision
- gamma  is the parameter showing the weight of Atlas based decision for alzheimer brain images (only for such patient is effective)
-Iteration is for Markov Random field calculation for all voxel neighbors, increasing might take time to finish (6 min to 1 hour)
- If the results are not satisfying, check if the eyes are wrongly detected or not. They should be remove from the mask.
